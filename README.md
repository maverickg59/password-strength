# Password Strength Meter

This project is a password strength meter built using [zxcvbn password strength estimator](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn). It provides a visual representation of password strength to help users understand the difference between weak and strong passwords or passphrases.

---

## Features

- **Password Strength Analysis**: Estimates password strength based on common patterns and weaknesses.
- **Crack Time Estimation**: Displays time estimates for cracking passwords under different attack scenarios:
  - Online, no rate limiting
  - Online, rate-limited
  - Offline, fast hashing
  - Offline, slow hashing
- **Local Processing**: All computations are performed locally in the browser. No data is transmitted outside of your browser, ensuring user privacy.
- **Educational Tool**: Helps users learn about the characteristics of strong passwords and the importance of good password hygiene.

## Disclaimer

This tool is not intended for everyday use. It serves as an educational tool to demonstrate password strength concepts. Keep in mind that no password is truly safe; all passwords can eventually be cracked. Strong password hygiene involves making the process of cracking as challenging as possible for attackers.
